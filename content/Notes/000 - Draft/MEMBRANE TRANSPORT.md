# [[Simple Diffusion]]
# [[Facilitated Diffusion]]

# Osmosis
The diffusion of [[WATER|water]] from a high water potential to a low water potential through a partially permeable membrane. 
- partially permeable membrane $\implies$ only allows water molecules to pass through and solutes to stay behind
## Aquaporins
- [[MEMBRANE STRUCTURE#Integral protein|Channel protein]]
- Tetrameric ([[Quaternary structure]] with 4 subunits)
- Lined w/ [[hydrophilic]] side chains $\implies$ allow passage of water but not ions
- Bidirectional

$\implies$ water absorption goes vroom vroom
# [[Active Transport]]
# Membrane selectivity
