## Usage
- take up nutrients (ie: [[Glucose|glucose]] from lumen)
- remove secretory / waste into extracellular fluid
- maintain ion concentration (ie: $Na^+$ and $K^+$ in red blood cells)

## Types
- Direct - when energy from [[exergonic reaction]] used to transport
- Indirect (cotransport) - movement of solute A down concentration gradient causes movement of solute B against concentration gradient
