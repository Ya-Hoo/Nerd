## Totipotent
Can differentiate into any type of cells and give rise to complete organism
ex: morula
## Pluripotent
Can differentiate into many type of cells but cannot give rise to complete organism
ex: inner mass cells
## Multipotent
Can differentiate into closely-related types of cells
ex: cardiac tisssues
## Unipotent
Can regenerate but can only differentiate into their cell types
ex: liver cells can only make liver cells
