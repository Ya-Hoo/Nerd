## Embryonic stem cells
- pluripotent $\implies$ unlimited growth potential (can grow into any cell types)
## Adult stem cells
- multipotent or unipotent $\implies$ targeted treatments + lower risks of tumor development 
- more compatible with patients
- less ethical concerns: embryonic stem cells can only be obtained from destruction of embryos from IVF programs

Increasing potency of adult stem cells:
- introducing specific transcription factors to reprogram adult stem cells
- exposure to chemicals which de-specialises the adult stem cells
- genetic engineering
- co-culture in close proximity with embryonic cells
