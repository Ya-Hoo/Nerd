___
The organisation of different functions and processes within specific areas or structures within the cell that are separated byÂ plasma membranes
# Advantages
- Localised conditions - conditions can be maintained at optimal level
- Concentration of enzymes and substrates - can be concentrated in small area $\implies$ increasing metabolism efficiency (more frequent collisions)
- Isolation of substances - substances that can damage cells (ie: enzymes) will be isolated within a membrane
- Adaptations of numbers and locations - organelles can be easily transported to other areas of the cell
- Surface area - large area on membranes can become dense with proteins for a specific process
# Examples
## Lysosomes
- High concentration of enzymes $\implies$ higher digestion efficiency
- Separate acidic conditions
	- Optimal condition for enzymes
	- Protect cells from the acidic conditions
	- If were to bust, enzymes will denature $\implies$ no hydrolytic damage to cells
## Phagocytic vacuoles
Isolate hydrolytic enzymes from the cell:
- Protect the rest of the cells
- Allow for waste to be broken down safely
## Nucleus
- Allow post-transcriptional modificaiton of mRNA to occur before translation in cytoplasm
- Allow cytoplasm to send signals to nucleus
