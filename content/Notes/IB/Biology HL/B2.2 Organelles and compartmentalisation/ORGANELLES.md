___
Discrete subunits inside of prokaryotic / eukaryotic cells that are adapted to perform specific functions.
# Advantages:
*Allow more functions to be carried out in specialised units, thereby increasing the efficiency and specificity of the cellâ€™s functions*
# List of organelles
- No membrane: solid structures not enclosed by a phospholipid bilayer located within the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm
- Single membrane: sacs enclosed by a single layer of phospholipid bilayer
- Double membrane: structures enclosed by two layer of phospholipid bilayer

# Not an organelle
Cell wall - not in the cell
Cytoplasm - no specialised function
Cytoskeleton - not a discrete subunit, made of different components
