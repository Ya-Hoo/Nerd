# Origin of water
* Hypothesis: colossal impacts with icy celestial bodies approx 4.5 billion years ago
* Evidence: similarities between the abundance and the isotope ratios of hydrogen
* Considered the medium for life because:
	* First cells originated in water
	* Most life processes occur in this medium (a solvent that facilitates biological processes)

* How Earth retain water: 
	* sufficient gravity
	* Goldilocks zone $\implies$ water can exist as a liquid or ice form
