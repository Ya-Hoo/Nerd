*[[PROTEINS|proteins]] that have >1 [[CARBOHYDRATES|carbohydrates]] attached: can be directly attached to amino acids residues or form branched/linear chains that extend from protein surface. An example of a [[conjugated proteins]].*

Found in many cellular structures:
- extracellular matrix
- cell membranes
- secreted protein

## Roles
* Cell-cell recognition: act as markers on the surface of cells $\implies$ identify and interact appropriately
* Receptors: act as receptors $\implies$ receive signals from other cells or molecules
* Ligands: ions or molecules that bind to protein receptors to initiate signaling pathway
* Structural support: contribute to structural integrity, such as extracellular matrix

## Role in blood group
A or B antigens

Cases:
- A antigen $\implies$ A blood group
- B antigen $\implies$ B blood group
- A and B antigen $\implies$ AB blood group
- Neither $\implies$ O blood group

Compatibility = recognition and interaction of specific glycoproteins (antigens). If incompatible, immune system will see the other glycoproteins as threats and attack $\implies$ blood clump $\implies$ organ failure $\implies$ death
