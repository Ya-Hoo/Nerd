___
Complex macromolecules composed of $\ge1$ chains of [[Amino acids|amino acids]]. A chain of amino acids is called a polypeptide.
## Formation

The N-terminal (amino-terminal) end of the dipeptide refers to the free amino group that is not involved in the peptide bond, while the C-terminal (carboxyl-terminal) end refers to the unbound carboxyl group.
## Denaturation
Factors that cause [[denaturation]]:
- Temperature - high temperature can break the hydrogen bonds in the peptide bonds, causing the protein to unfold and lose function.
- pH - affect protein's solubility and shape by altering the protein's charge
