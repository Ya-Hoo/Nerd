Further folding of the polypeptide. Dependent on R-groups, which can form:
- hydrogen bonds
- ionic bonds
- disulfide covalent bonds
- hydrophobic interactions

$\implies$ stabilises protein structure
![[Pasted image 20240909182419.png]]
## Hydrogen bonds
- Between polar R-groups
- Stabilises structure by holding distant regions of the chain together
## Ionic bonds
- Between charged R-groups
- Furter help stabilisation
## Disulfide bonds
- Between pairs of cysteine amino acid residues (contains S atoms)
- Stabilises tertiary and quarternary structure, maintaining 3D shape
## Hydrophobic interactions
- Between non-polar amino acids
- Clump into hydrophobic clusters in the interior $\implies$ stability + allow membrane embed
