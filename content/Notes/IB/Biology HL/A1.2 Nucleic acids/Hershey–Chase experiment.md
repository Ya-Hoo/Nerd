Bacteriophages are known to inject genetic material into bacteria. 

Radioactive labelling allow us to observe molecules:
- $S^{35}$ used to mark protein capsid
- $P^{32}$ used to mark DNA molecules

Bacteriophage is then allowed to infect the bacteria, injecting their material into it.

Bacteriophages detached from bacteria, and the solution is centrifuged so bacteria pellet congregates at the bottom

At the bottom, $P^{32}$ was detect $\implies$ DNA is the genetic material.
