- [[Glycoproteins]]
- Binding w/ adjacent cells or extracellular matrix
- Examples:
	- cadherins
	- integrins
	- selectins

## Adhesive junctions (anchoring junctions)
- including adherens junctions and desmosomes
- epithelial and cardiac cells
- $f(x)$:
	- cell-to-cell adhesion
	- structural stability
	- withstand mechanical stress
## Tight junctions (occluding junctions)
- epithelial cells
- forms tight seal between adjacent cells
- $f(x)$: prevents unregulated movement of molecules across the barrier
## Gap junctions (communicating junctions)
- several cell types
- intracellular channels
- $f(x)$: cell-to-cell transfer of small molecules
