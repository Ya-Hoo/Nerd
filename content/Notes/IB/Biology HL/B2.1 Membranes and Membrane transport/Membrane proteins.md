[[PROTEINS]]
## Integral protein
- embedded in the lipid bilayer
- [[amphipathic]] molecules (the embedded part is [[hydrophobic]] while the exposed part is [[hydrophilic]])
- most are transmembrane
## Peripheral protein
* on surface of lipid bilayer (can be inside or outside cell)
* [[hydrophilic]]
## Functions (JETRAT)
- *Junctions* - serve to connect and join two cells together  
- *Enzymes* - fixing to membranes localises metabolic pathways  
- *Transport* - facilitated diffusion and active transport  
- *Recognition* - markers for cellular identification  
- *Anchorage* - attachment points for extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton  
- *Transduction* - function as receptors for peptide hormones
