## Mechanism
1. Ligand binds to binding site (receptor)
2. Conformational change in channel
3. Ions diffuse in
4. Enzyme breaks down ligand
5. Channel closed
## Example
Neurotransmitter-gated ion channel
Ligand: Acetylcholine 
Receptor: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) - composed of 5 subunits: 2$\alpha$, 1$\beta$, 1$\delta$, 1$\gamma$/$\varepsilon$  
Enzyme: Cholinesterase 

1. Binding of acetylcholine results in conformational change that opens channel
2. Sodium ions diffuse down the channel
3. Within milliseconds, cholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine and channel closes
4. Potassium channel ion open and $K^+$ exit ([[repolarisation]])

Nicotine can also bind to these receptors
