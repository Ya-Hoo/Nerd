- aka $Na^+$/$K^+$ ATPase:
- an enzyme that generates energy by the breakdown of ATP
- creates asymmetric distribution of ions with active transport of $K^+$ into cells and $Na^+$ out of cells
## Mechanism
![[Pasted image 20241211083825.png]]

1. Initially, $Na^+$/$K^+$ pump is open to the inside of cell $\implies$ $Na^+$ bind with 3 sites
2. Binding triggers the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate group
3. Phosphate attaches to pump and cause conformational change
4. Pump opens to exterior and release $Na^+$
5. $K^+$ attached to 2 binding sites and cause phosphate to detach
6. Pump undergoes conformational change and regain original form

$\implies$ for 1ATP, 3$Na^+$ out and 2$K^+$ in $\implies$ high concentration of $K^+$ inside cell $\implies$ establish and maintain the voltage across the membrane

So plays important role in reestablishing membrane potential after passage of a nerve impulse
