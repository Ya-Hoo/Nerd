| Transport             | Selectivity (✓/⨯) | Membrane protein (✓/⨯)               | Reason                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple diffusion      | ⨯                 | ⨯                                    | any molecules, as long as small and hydrophobic, can pass through    |
| Osmosis (\*)          | ✓                 | ⨯ (altho aquaporins can speed it up) | only water can pass through membrane, solute stays back              |
| Facilitated diffusion | ✓                 | channel/carrier proteins             | the proteins are selective (ie: calcium channel only accept calcium) |
| Active transport      | ✓                 | pump proteins                        | same reason as above                                                 |
(\*) According to bio teacher; Kognity did not include Osmosis as a part of Membrane selectivity
# Bulk transport mechanisms
Both requires energy so is a form of [[Active Transport]]
- ## [[Endocytosis]]
- ## [[Exocytosis]]
