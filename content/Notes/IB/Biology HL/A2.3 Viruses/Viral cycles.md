## Lytic cycle
![[Pasted image 20241211203924.png]]

1. *Attachment* - virus attaches to host cell by binding to specific receptor on cell surface
2. *Entry* - virus injects genetic material into host cell
3. *Replication* - viral genetic takes over host cell's machinery and forces it to replicate viral materials
4. *Assembly* - new viral particles are assembled within host cells
5. *Release* - host cell burst (lysis) and release newly formed viruses
## Lysogenic cycle
![[Pasted image 20241211204013.png]]

1.  *Attachment* - virus attaches to host cell by binding to specific receptor on cell surface
2. *Entry* - virus injects genetic material into host cell
3. *Integration* - viral gene integrates into host's genome, becoming a prophage or provirus and remains dormant
4. *Activation* (initiate lytic cycle) - triggered by environmental stressors, viral genome is activated and enter lytic cycle
