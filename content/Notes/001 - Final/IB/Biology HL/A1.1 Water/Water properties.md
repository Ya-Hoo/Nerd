# Water properties
## [[cohesion|Cohesion]]
* Occur as a result of water's polarity
* Although individual hydrogen bonds are weak, the large number of bonds present gives cohesive forces great strength
* Gives water its surface tension
* Enable the transpiration column to form
## [[adhesion|Adhesion]]
* Water molecules bond to other molecules that are polar or charged
* Although individual hydrogen bonds are weak, the large number of bonds present gives adhesive forces great strength
* Enable the transpiration column to form
## [[solvent|Solvent]]
Water can dissolve substance that contains charged particles or polar molecules by breaking the bond holding the solute together. Solutes can either be:
* [[hydrophilic]]: easily dissolve in water, include all polar molecules, ions, and any molecules water adhere to
* [[hydrophobic]]: do not easily dissolve in water, include non-polar molecules  

The way water dissolves substances is by forming shells around them, stopping the solutes from clumping together in solution.
## Transparency
Light can penetrate molecules of water:
- plants can grow on the ocean floor and carry out photosynthesis
- life underwater is possible
## Thermal conductivity
### [[specific heat capacity|Specific Heat Capacity]]
*High specific heat capacity - store lots of energy before its temperature changes.*

$\implies$ stable env, stable internal medium to maintain constant conditions
$\implies$ warm-blooded animals can use blood to transport thermal energy from area w/ lots of heat to areas that lose heat more readily
### [[latent heat|Latent Heat]]
*High latent heat - takes lots of energy for water to change state.* 

$\implies$ coolant: absorbs thermal and carry them away as they evaporate
1. Hypothalamus detects $\uparrow$ temperature
2. Produces sweat
3. Water has high latent heat of vaporization due to hydrogen bonds between O and H
4. Evaporation takes energy away from skin's surface, reducing temperature of organism.
## [[buoyancy|Buoyancy]] and [[viscosity|Viscosity]]
- Buoyancy$\implies$helps aquatic animal swim at and adjust to different levels of the sea
- Viscosity:$\implies$aquatic animals thus have to expend much more energy to move
