# Water molecules and their bonds

Chemical formula: H<sub>2</sub>O
![[Pasted image 20241008234203.png]]

1. Oxygen has more protons than hydrogen atoms (more electronegativity) 
2. More electrons pulled towards oxygen
3. Oxygen end becomes slightly negative ($\delta^-$) and hydrogen end becomes slightly positive ($\delta^+$)
4. Water is a [[polar|polar]] molecule

| Substance    | Polarity                         | Transportation method                                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Salt (NaCl)  | polar                            | Dissolved in plasma                                                                                |
| Glucose      | polar                            | Dissolved in plasma                                                                                |
| Amino acids  | polar (some more than the other) | Dissolved in plasma                                                                                |
| Oxygen       | non-polar                        | Small amounts dissolved but low saturation point. Often attached to haemoglobin for transportation |
| Fat molecule | non-polar                        | Does not dissolve, carried inside lipoprotein complexes                                            |
| Cholesterol  | non-polar                        | Does not dissolve, carried inside lipoprotein complexes                                            |
