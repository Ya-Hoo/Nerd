___
# Water molecules and their bonds

Chemical formula: H<sub>2</sub>O

1. Oxygen has more protons than hydrogen atoms (more electronegativity) 
2. More electrons pulled towards oxygen
3. Oxygen end becomes slightly negative ($\delta^-$) and hydrogen end becomes slightly positive ($\delta^+$)
4. Water is a [[polar|polar]] molecule

Water can associate via weak hydrogen bonds.
# Properties
## [[Cohesion]]
Definition: *A property that makes molecules attracted to each other*

* Occur as a result of water's polarity
* Although individual hydrogen bonds are weak, the large number of bonds present gives cohesive forces great strength
* Gives water its surface tension
* Enable the transpiration column to form
## [[Adhesion]]
Definition: *Ability of dissimilar molecules to stick together*

* Water molecules bond to other molecules that are polar or charged
* Although individual hydrogen bonds are weak, the large number of bonds present gives adhesive forces great strength
* Enable the transpiration column to form
## [[Solvent]]
Water can dissolve substance that contains charged particles or polar molecules by breaking the bond holding the solute together.

* [[hydrophilic]]: easily dissolve in water, include all polar molecules, ions, and any molecules water adhere to
* [[hydrophobic]]: do not easily dissolve in water, include non-polar molecules
## Thermal conductivity
### [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
*High specific heat capacity - store lots of energy before its temperature changes.*

$\implies$ stable env, stable internal medium to maintain constant conditions
$\implies$ warm-blooded animals can use blood to transport thermal energy from area w/ lots of heat to areas that lose heat more readily
### [[High Latent Heat]]
*Takes lots of energy for water to change state.* 

$\implies$ coolant: absorbs thermal and carry them away as they evaporate
## [[Buoyancy]] and [[Viscosity]]
Buoyancy: net upward force exert by a liquid
$\implies$ helps aquatic animal swim at and adjust to different levels of the sea

Viscosity: resistance of a liquid to flow. More viscous, less flow (honey)
$\implies$ aquatic animals thus have to expend much more energy to move
## Origin of water
* Hypothesis: colossal impacts with icy celestial bodies approx 4.5 billion years ago
* Evidence: similarities between the abundance and the isotope ratios of hydrogen

* How Earth retain water: 
	* sufficient gravity
	* Goldilocks zone $\implies$ water can exist as a liquid or ice form
