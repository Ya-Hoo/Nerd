Arrangement and interaction of two or more polypeptide chains.

Can form:
- [[conjugated proteins]]
- [[non-conjugate proteins]]

Once proteins take their final form, they can either be:

| Properties | Fibrous                                           | Globular                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Shape      | Long and narrow, secondary structure              | Spherical, tertiary structure                  |
| Role       | Structural support                                | Functional (ie: catalytic)                     |
| Solubility | (Usually) insoluble                               | (Usually) soluble                              |
| Sequence   | Regular amino acids sequence                      | Irregular amino acids sequence                 |
| Stability  | Less sensitive to environmental changes           | More sensitive to environmental changes        |
| Examples   | collagen, myosin, fibrin, actin, keratin, elastin | haemoglobin, catalase, insulin, immunoglobulin |
