($\delta^-$) phosphate head (hydrophilic) && Non-polar fatty acid (hydrophobic) $\implies$ [[amphipathic|amphipathic]]

When in (aq) environment, heads will face solution while tail orient towards each other $\implies$ self-organise into bilayer

The phospholipid bilayer formed by these interactions makes a good barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, because water and other polar or charged substances cannot easily cross the hydrophobic core of the membrane.
