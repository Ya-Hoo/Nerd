Formula: $C_6H_{12}O_6$

Monosaccharide - *simplest form of carbohydrate, consisting of a single sugar unit that **cannot be broken down into smaller units by hydrolysis***

* Properties and uses:
	* Two isomers; **α-glucose** and **β-glucose**. *NOTE*: only in the formation of a polymer can the $C_1$ atom be fixed and able to assign α and β.
	* Soluble because [[polar]] because of the ($-OH$) groups. Plus $O$ has partial ($\delta^-$ ), therefore ($C-H$) has partial ($\delta^+$)
	*  Stable (because its a cyclic molecule)
	* Can be oxidised $\implies$ produce ATP
