Largest class of lipids
$f(x)$ = **long term energy storage**, heat insulators, protection for key organs

Typically stored in adipocytes

| Property of lipid                                      | How this help it triglycerides to act as an energy store                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Immiscible (does not mix) with water                   | Does not affect the osmotic balance in cells                                                     |
| Release twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates | More efficient and dense energy storage so much energy can be compactly stored in the long term. |
| Chemically stable                                      | The stability allows it to be stored for a long time without deforming.                          |
