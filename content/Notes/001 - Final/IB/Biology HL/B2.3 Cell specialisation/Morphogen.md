A chemical in the cell the concentration gradient of which determines the fate of surrounding cells.

- Secreted during the early embryo

[[Differentiation]] process:
- All cells produce morphogens which diffuse to surrounding tissues. 
- These chemicals dictate the cellâ€™s gene repression or activation. 
- The farther away a cell is from this source cell, the less concentrated the morphogens will be. 
- Cell detects concentration using receptors
- Different concentrations of morphogens produce different specialisations for the cells.
