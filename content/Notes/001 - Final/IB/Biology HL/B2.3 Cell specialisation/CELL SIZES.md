___
The rate of energy consumption is a function of their mass / volume.
The rate of material exchange is a function of their surface area.

As cell grows, V$\uparrow$  faster than A$\uparrow$  

If metabolic rate exceeds the rate of consumption / material exchange, the cell will die.
Hence cells tend to divide and remain small to maintain a high A:V ratio to survive.

(However cannot be too small as there won't be enough spaces to contain all the necessary organelles)
