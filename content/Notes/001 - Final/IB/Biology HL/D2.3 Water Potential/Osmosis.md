The diffusion of [[WATER|water]] from a [[hypotonic]] solution to a [[hypertonic]] solution through a partially permeable membrane. 
- partially permeable membrane $\implies$ only allows water molecules to pass through and solutes to stay behind
## Aquaporins
- [[Membrane proteins#Integral protein|Channel protein]]
- Tetrameric ([[Quaternary structure]] with 4 subunits)
- Lined w/ [[hydrophilic]] side chains $\implies$ allow passage of water but not ions
- Bidirectional
$\implies$ water absorption goes vroom vroom
## Effect on cells

### Animal cells
- In hypertonic solution: water move outside the cell. Cell will shrivel ([[crenation]])
- In hypotonic solution: may burst (lysis)
- In isotonic solution: dynamic equilibrium $\implies$ no changes
### Plant cells
- In hypertonic solution: water move outside the cell. Cell will undergo [[plasmolysis]]
- In hypotonic solution: water moves in $\implies$ cell membrane pushes against cell wall (turgid)
- In isotonic solution: dynamic equilibrium $\implies$ no changes (flaccid) and plants look wilted
