A measure of potential energy of water per unit volume of water, relative to the potential energy of pure water at standard conditions (atm pressure and 20$^oC$)

unit: kPa

Pure water (highest possible) = 0 kPa  
The more negative, the harder it is for water to move

Equation:
$$
\Psi_w = \Psi_s + \Psi_p
$$

where:
- $\Psi_w$ is water potential
- $\Psi_s$ is [[solute potential]] (always negative)
- $\Psi_p$ is pressure potential (aka [[turgor pressure]])

Solute potential is *always* constant (unless solutes are removed)  
Pressure potential can be:
- positive, and is exerted outwards from a cell (ie: root pressure in root hair cells)
- negative, suction exerted on water (ie: xylem and transpiration)

Example:
- Plant cell in hypotonic solution
