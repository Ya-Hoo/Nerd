Freeze sample to cryogenic temperature (less than $-180^o C$) to fix molecules. Then viewed using electron microscope.
$\implies$ freezing makes the molecule more firm and stable
$\implies$ also able to take snapshots of the molecules at different orientations and construct a 3D model
$\implies$ improve the resolution of the image and reduces potential damage from electron beam
