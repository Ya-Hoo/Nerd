# Terminology
[[resolution|Resolution]]
[[magnification|Magnification]]
# History
- Developed in $17^{th}$ century independently by Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek
- First major development: Light microscope - $19^{th}$ century
# Light microscopy
## Limitations
- Limited resolution $\implies$ difficult to observe small details
- Limited depth of field $\implies$ hard to focus on a certain layer
- Need to stain samples $\implies$ otherwise samples will be transparent and unobservable
# Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
## Mechanism
1. Pass beam of electrons through specimen
2. Electrons absorbed by denser parts but scattered in less dense areas
3. Electron detector pick them up & compile into image
## Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages
	- Uses shorter wavelength (electron vs light)
		- Higher resolution
		- Higher magnification
- Disadvantages
	- However, can damage specimen so can only study dead specimen
	- Can only produce black and white images >< images usually stained with heavy metal ions

# Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
## Mechanism
1. Electrons are shot at the specimen
2. Its reflection is measured
3. Form 3D images of specimen
# Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages same as that of TEM
- Disadvantages
	- Specimen gets damaged/killed in the process
	- Have to stain with harsh chemicals
	- ﹩﹩﹩
# Types of Microscopy Work
[[Fluorescent stains and immunofluorescence]]
[[Freeze-Fracture electron microscopy]]
[[Cryogenic electron microscopy]]
