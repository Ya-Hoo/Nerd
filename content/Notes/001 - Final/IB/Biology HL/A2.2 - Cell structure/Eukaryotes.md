## Animal vs Plants vs Fungus
### Animal cells 
![[Pasted image 20241007214407.png|400]]
Uniqueness:
- has centrioles
- contains lysosome
- temporary and smaller vacuoles (unlike plant cells)
- may contain cilia (epithelial cell) and flagella (sperm)

Plant cells  
![[Pasted image 20241007214516.png|400]]
Uniqueness:
- has chloroplasts and plastids
- larger vacuoles compared to animal cells
- cell wall = cellulose

Fungal cells
![[Pasted image 20241007214533.png|400]]
Uniqueness:
- has larger vacuoles
- has centrioles (not present in most fungi, except male gametes of some)
- reproduce via budding
- chitin cell wall
