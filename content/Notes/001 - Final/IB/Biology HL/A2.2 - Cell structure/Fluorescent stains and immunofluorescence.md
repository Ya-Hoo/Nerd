A fluorescent tag (fluorophore) is attached to specific antibodies specific for the antigens on the structure being viewed.

When certain wavelength is shone onto the tag, it will emit light that appears as brightly coloured spots.

(Secondary immunofluorescent (right): utilizes $2$ types of antibodies whereas only one of them have a conjugated fluorophore. The conjugated one = secondary antibody, the unconjugated one = primary antibody)

Fluorescent stains/dyes: dyes that are preferentially attached to certain structures or organelles. Can either be used alone or attached to secondary structures (such as antibodies)
