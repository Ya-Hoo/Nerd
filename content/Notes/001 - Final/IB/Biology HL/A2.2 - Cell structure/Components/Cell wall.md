**NOT** considered an organelle (as it is outside of cell), rather it is considered a structural component

$f(x)$: 
- provides structural support
- prevents lysis
- maintaining cell shape
- resist high osmotic pressure
## Prokaryotes
* Composed of peptidoglycan
## Plants
Secreted by **ALL** plant cells
Composed of mainly [[CARBOHYDRATES|cellulose]]
- Permeable: does not affect transportation in and out of cells
- Strong: gives support to cell and prevent [[Plasma membrane|plasma membrane]] from bursting under pressure
- Hard to digest: resistant to being broken down $\implies$ last long time without replacement
## Fungus
Composed of chitin
## EM Micrograph
