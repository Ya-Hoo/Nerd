**YES** considered [[ORGANELLES|organelle]]  

Sacs with fluid inside.  

Single membrane. May have coating made of [[clathrin]].
Very small.

Made by [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) |RER]], [[Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)|SER]], and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Can also pinch off of other membranous organelles or the [[Plasma membrane|plasma membrane]] during endocytosis.

$f(x)$:
- transport materials (because they may be too large to pass directly through the plasma membrane):
	- between cellular components
	- cells and the environment (endocytosis and exocytosis)
