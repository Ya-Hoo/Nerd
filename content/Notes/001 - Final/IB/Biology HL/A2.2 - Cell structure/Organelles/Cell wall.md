- Extracellular component (NOT AN ORGANELLE)
- Provides structural support, prevents lysis, maintaining cell shape, resist high osmotic pressure
## Prokaryotes
* Composed of peptidoglycan
## Plants
- Secreted by **ALL** plant cells
- Composed of mainly [[CARBOHYDRATES|cellulose]]
	- Permeable: does not affect transportation in and out of cells
	- Strong: gives support to cell and prevent [[Plasma membrane|plasma membrane]] from bursting under pressure
	- Hard to digest: resistant to being broken down $\implies$ last long time without replacement
## Fungus
- Composed of chitin
