___
[[Macromolecules]] composed of repeating [[Nucleotides|nucleotide]]

There are two types:
- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)
- RNA (ribonucleic acid)

# Structure
## DNA
- Double helix: 2 strands of nucleotides wrapped around each other
- antiparallel: One strand going 5'-3', one strand going 3'-5'

## Compare and contrast DNA, RNA

| Factor                 | Similarities                                           | Differences           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Nucleotide composition | Made of sugar, phosphate, base                         | ATCG vs AUCG          |
| Type of pentose        | Both have sugar-phosphate backbone                     | Deoxyribose vs Ribose |
| Number of strands      | Both are polymers made from recurring nucleotide units | 2 vs 1                |
# Complementary base pairing
- Stabilise structure of the double helix
- Accuracy in DNA replication
- Gene expression
- $4^n$ possible combinations, where $n$ is length of chain
# [[Nucleosomes]]
Allow packing and protection of DNA
