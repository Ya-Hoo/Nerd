## Structure
![[Pasted image 20240914124911.png]]

Three components:
- Pentose sugar:
	![[Pasted image 20240914124610.png]]
	
- Nitrogenous base
	- contains Nitrogen
	- Has one/two rings in its structure
	- Very reactive and readily form H-bonds
	- Where genetic information in stored; 3 bases $\implies$ codon $\implies$ amino acids. This was found out in the [[Hersheyâ€“Chase experiment]]
	
- Phosphate group
	- Acidic
	- Negatively-charged
## Bonding
Link through covalent bond: between phosphate group attached to 5' C and hydroxyl attached to 3'

## Bases
* Purines
	* Adenine (A)
	* Guanine (G)
* Pyrimidines
	- Thymine (T)
	- Cytosine (C)
	- Uracil (U) - only in RNA

Hydrogen bonds between bases (pyrine bonds with pyrimidine $\implies$ three rings in total so uniform width and structure)
A=T
C $\equiv$ G
