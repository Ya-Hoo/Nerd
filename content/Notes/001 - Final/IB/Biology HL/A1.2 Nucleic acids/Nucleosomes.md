*Basic structural unit of DNA*

Coil around 8 histone proteins held together by an additional histone attached to linker DNA $\implies$ fibre (solenoid)

Prokaryotes does not use Nucleosome $\implies$ naked DNA

DNA supercoil: DNA wound back on itself multiple times so that it becomes compact $\implies$ DNA can be moved around during cell division

Nucleosomes = positive charge $\implies$ negatively charged DNA to bind with histone protein
