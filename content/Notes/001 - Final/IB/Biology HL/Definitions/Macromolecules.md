Large molecules that are made up of smaller building blocks called monomers - individual subunits that can be linked together to form long chain polymers.
## Covalent bonds
Properties of carbon covalent bonds:
* Stable ($\uparrow$ chain = $\uparrow$ stable)
* Carbon can bond up to 4 different atoms $\implies$ formation of diverse molecules
* Can form chain, ring, and branched structures
* Able to bind with non-metals (ie: H, O, S)
## Four main classes:
* [[CARBOHYDRATES|Carbohydrates]]
* [[LIPIDS|Lipids]]
* [[PROTEINS|Proteins]]
* [[NUCLEIC ACIDS|Nucleic acids]]
## Formation (anabolic):
* Condensation reaction - polymerisation reaction in which two molecules join together. One molecule loses hydrogen atom ($-H$) while other loses hydroxyl group ($-OH$) so water is formed as byproduct.
* Require synthase enzymes
## Breakdown (catabolic):
- Hydrolysis reaction - water used to break the covalent bonds of a polymer into monomers
- Require hydrolase enzymes
