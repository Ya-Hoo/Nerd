The membrane is organised as a mosaic of proteins present within a fluid lipid bilayer

Reasons:
- Facilitate cell movement
- Membrane transport
- Membrane selectivity lost if too fluid
## [[Fatty acids]]
Fluidity regulated by fatty acids:
- saturated = higher melting point = stability
- unsaturated = lower melting point (cus kinks) = fluidity

When ‚ùÑ, phospholipids closer $\implies$ membrane more gel-like ($\downarrow$ fluidity). However the kinks in unsaturated fatty acids prevents molecules from packing too closely $\implies$ maintain fluidity. 
So animals living in cold environments will have more unsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids
## Cholesterol
- [[amphipathic|Amphipathic]] [[Steroids|steroids]] 
- Hydrophobic region = four steroid rings + hydrocarbon side chain
- Hydrophilic region = hydroxyl ($-OH$) group

Mechanism for modulator of fluidity:
- Makes phospholipids pack more tightly
- Presence of cholesterol restricts movement of phospholipids $\implies$ $\downarrow$ fluidity
- Also reduces permeability to hydrophilic molecules
- Disrupts regular packing of phospholipids $\implies$ $\uparrow$ flexibility as it prevents tails from crystalising

- Low temperature: prevent phospholipids from fitting closely together
- High temperature: stabilises membrane and reduces fluidity
