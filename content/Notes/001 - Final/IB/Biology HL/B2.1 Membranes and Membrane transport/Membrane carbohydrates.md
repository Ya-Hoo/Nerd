[[CARBOHYDRATES]]  
![[Pasted image 20241210233754.png]]
## Glycolipids
- Carbs + lipids
- [[amphipathic|Amphipathic]]
- Often restricted to external surface
- Carbo group ([[polar]]) protrude into extracellular environment, lipid ([[non-polar]]) embedded in layer
- Classification:
	- glycoglycerolipids or glycerol-based lipids
	- glycosphingolipids or derivatives of sphingosine (ie: cerebrosides and gangliosides)
## [[Glycoproteins]]
- Oligosaccharide (short carbohydrate) + protein
- Carbo protrude into extracellular environment
# Functions
- Recognition: markers to help cell recognise each other (ie: immune system and antigens)
- Cell adhesion: cell attach to cell $\implies$ tissue
- Signalling: receptors
- Protection: glycocalyx formation (all the carbohydrates protruded outside, forming sticky layer)
