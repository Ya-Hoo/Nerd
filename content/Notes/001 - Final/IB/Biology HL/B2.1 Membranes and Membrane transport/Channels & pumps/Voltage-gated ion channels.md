## Open stage
* Stimulus $\implies$ $\uparrow$ potential difference from resting potential (-70mV) to above threshold (-50mV)
* Activation gate open rapidly
* Sodium ions enter, interior becomes (+) - [[depolarisation]]
* [[action potential|Action potential]] fired
## Inactivated stage
* At the peak potential (+30mV), inactivation gate engaged and close channel
* No action potential fired regardless of stimulus
* Potassium channel opens and $K^+$ ions released
## Closed stage
- Once voltage is lowered ([[repolarisation]]) through release of $K^+$ ions, activation gate closed and inactivation gate disengaged.
