- One solute down the concentration gradient (favourable) coupled with one solute against the concentration gradient (unfavourable)
- [[endergonic reaction]]

## Mechanism
1. $Na^+$ bind to binding site on outer surface of the cotransporter
2. Simultaneously, glucose molecules binds to binding site
3. Results in conformational change $\implies$ transport both molecules inside cells
4. Transport of $Na^+$ is [[exergonic reaction]] so release energy that is used for transport of glucose
## Examples
- Transported from intestinal lumen to epithelial cells
- Reabsorption of glucose in nephron
