[[Simple Diffusion|Diffusion]] assisted by transport proteins - *DOES NOT REQUIRE ATP!!!*
Why? some molecules too big or too charged to cross membrane
## Channel proteins
- [[MEMBRANE STRUCTURE#Integral protein|Transmembrane integral protein]]
- Typically let charged molecules through
- Example: ion channels 
- Selectivity due to:
	- binding sites of [[Amino acids|amino acid]] side chains = highly ion-specific (mostly only allow one type of ion)
	- size
- Can close / open (gated) from following stimuli:
	- changes in Voltage
	- Ligand-gated channels / binding of small molecules
	- Mechanical forces (ie: pressure)

## Carrier proteins
- [[MEMBRANE STRUCTURE#Integral protein|Transmembrane integral protein]]
- Typically let large molecules through
- Mechanism:
	- Molecules bind to carrier protein on a VERY specific site
	- Conformational change
	- Molecule is transferred to other side
- Example: [[Glucose|glucose]] transporter (GLUT)
