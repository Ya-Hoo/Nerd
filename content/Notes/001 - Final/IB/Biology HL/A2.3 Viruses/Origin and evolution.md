## Origins
There is huge diversity in [[Viral Structure|viral structure]] $\implies$ several possible origins  
- ancient RNA/DNA molecules that became encapsulated in protein coat (protovirus)
- [[viroids]]
- [[transposons]]
- cells that lost their ability to live independently and had to rely on other cells
## Evolution
Share common features $\implies$ [[convergent evolution]]  
Reasons including:
- viruses that infect different cell types have similar mechanism for entering and replicating
- viruses that infect different types of host organisms have similar mechanism for evading immune system and spreading
- viruses that infect different types of host organisms have similar shapes and sizes
## Rapid rates of evolution
- many RNA viruses are retrovirus which uses error prone replication such as reverse transcriptase enzyme and RNA polymerase so mutation rate x10000 higher than DNA virus
- can exchange genetic material through [[horizontal gene transfer]] and [[recombination]]
- short generation time and high reproductive rate
### Case study
HIV:
- Reverse transcriptase $\implies$ high mutation rates
- Recombination $\implies$ can exchange resistant materials
Influenza:
- High mutation rate in surface proteins $\implies$ evade immune system
- Reassortment (infects host cell with another influenza then exchange genetic material) $\implies$ emergence of new strands
COVID-19
- Mutations in spike proteins
- High replication rate
- Lots of variants
