| Genetic material | DNA or RNA. RNA viruses can be retrovirus (directly uses RNA to replicate) or not (uses DNA intermediates to replicate). |
| Fixed size       | reaches max size upon creation                                                                                           |
| Capsid           | protein shell that surrounds and protects the genetic material                                                           |
| Cytoplasm        | nope                                                                                                                     |
## Diversity in structure
### Capsid:
- Can be simple & spherical (ie: influenza)
- Can be complex (ie: bacteriophages)
### Genetic material:
- Single-stranded RNA (ie: HIV)
- Double-stranded RNA (ie: rotavirus)
- Single-stranded DNA (ie: parvovirus)
- Double-stranded DNA (ie: bacteriophage)

In terms of length, some has 4 genes while others can have 2500 genes.
### Enveloped
- Membrane that surrounds the capsid, made of lipids and proteins
- Acquired from host cell membrane when released
- Additional protection + disguise from immune system

Virus without envelope = more stable and resistant to environmental factors (cus lipids can be damaged by heat, light and chemicals)

## Examples

| Virus                | Enveloped | Genetic material                   |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Bacteriophage lambda | no        | DNA \| double-stranded \| circular |
| COVID-19             | yes       | RNA \| single-stranded \| linear   |
| HIV                  | yes       | RNA \| single-stranded \| linear   |
