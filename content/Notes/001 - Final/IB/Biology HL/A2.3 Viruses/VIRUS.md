___
non-cellular agents that infect cells and reproduce inside them.

known as: [[obligate]] intracellular [[parasite]]  
Dependent on host for life processes, including:
- energy: does not produce energy on its own, need for replication
- nutrients: cannot obtain nutrients on its own, need nutrients as building blocks for replication
- replication machinery: rely on host's ribosomes and enzymes to transcribe and translate genetic material
- transport: depend on host cells to move around the body or to other host cells

Can invade hosts through different ways:
1. endosome: invagination of membrane during endocytosis
2. receptor-mediated fusion: similar to receptor-mediated endocytosis
